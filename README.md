My first TensorFlow [exercise](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/keras_example) was building a very simple 3 layer perceptron that recognized hand-written digits. Now we have come full circle.

[MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is used for training and testing

- `cargo run --relase -- train` will launch the training process
- `cargo run --relase -- demo` will launch a GUI to test the model. press C for clearing and S to load a verification sample. Model results will be displayed on the standar output.
